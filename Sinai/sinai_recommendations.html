                                <h2 class="decorative-heading">Key Findings from Supervised and Unsupervised Analyses</h2>
                                
                                <p>Across our analysis using Random Forest, Logistic Regression models, and K-modes clustering, several key factors consistently emerged as strong predictors of ED readmissions. 
                                    Critical among them were food security, unmet social needs, and CHW engagement metrics, including time spent with patients and the number of contact attempts. Additionally, 
                                    health insurance type and the type of referral—particularly high-risk admissions—played a significant role in determining patient outcomes. These findings highlight the importance 
                                    of addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) alongside medical interventions to effectively reduce readmission rates and improve patient care.
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Type of Referral & High-Risk Patients
                                        <ul><br/>
                                            <li>
                                                Patients referred as high-risk admissions had consistently higher readmission rates. This emphasizes the need for targeted follow-ups and specialized interventions for these individuals.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>
                                                Food insecurity was a major predictor of readmissions across all models. CHWs should not only connect patients with food assistance programs but also follow up to ensure proper utilization.
                                            </li><br/>
                                            <li>
                                                Patients with unmet social needs were more likely to be readmitted, highlighting the importance of tracking and addressing these concerns through CHW interventions.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                                While CHW engagement reduced readmissions, patients with more than four contact attempts still faced high readmission risks. This suggests the need to assess the 
                                                effectiveness of interactions rather than increasing the number of follow-ups.

                                                CHWs should collaborate with community organizations to provide assistance in these areas.

                                                Rather than increasing the number of contact attempts, efforts should focus on enhancing 
                                                the quality of interactions and tailoring interventions for complex cases.

                                                Since PCP visits alone did not significantly reduce readmissions, better integration between 
                                                CHWs and healthcare providers is needed to ensure continuous patient support and preventive care.

                                <p>By addressing these social and medical risk factors, CHWs can play a crucial role in reducing ED readmissions and improving overall patient outcomes.</p>
